        Have you ever noticed in the movies when the “super hacker,” — you know,
        the guy who can break into the ultra-secure military computer in under
        thirty seconds — sits down at the computer, he never touches a mouse?
        It's because movie makers realize that we, as human beings,
        instinctively know the only way to really get anything done on a
        computer is by typing on a keyboard!
      </p>
      <p>
        Most computer users today are only familiar with the graphical user
        interface (GUI) and have been taught by vendors and pundits that the
        command line interface (CLI) is a terrifying thing of the past. This is
        unfortunate, because a good command line interface is a marvelously
        expressive way of communicating with a computer in much the same way the
        written word is for human beings. It's been said that “graphical user
        interfaces make easy tasks easy, while command line interfaces make
        difficult tasks possible” and this is still very true today.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="What_is_The_Shell?">
      <header>What Is The Shell?</header>
      <p>
        When we speak of the command line, we are really referring to the shell.
        The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to
        the operating system to carry out. Almost all Linux distributions supply
        a shell program from the GNU Project called bash. The name “bash” is an
        acronym for “Bourne Again SHell”, a reference to the fact bash is an
        enhanced replacement for sh, the original Unix shell program written by
        Steve Bourne.
      </p>
      <h2>Terminal Emulators</h2>
      <p>
        When using a graphical user interface, we need another program called a
        terminal emulator to interact with the shell. If we look through our
        desktop menus, we will probably find one. KDE uses konsole and GNOME
        uses gnome-terminal, though it's likely called simply “terminal” on our
        menu. There are a number of other terminal emulators available for
        Linux, but they all basically do the same thing; give us access to the
        shell. You will probably develop a preference for one or another based
        on the number of bells and whistles it has.
      </p>
      <h2>Your First Keystrokes</h2>
      <p>
        So let's get started. Launch the terminal emulator! Once it comes up, we
        should see something like this:
      </p>
      <code>[me@linuxbox ~]$</code>
      <p>
        This is called a shell prompt and it will appear whenever the shell is
        ready to accept input. While it may vary in appearance somewhat
        depending on the distribution, it will usually include your
        username@machinename, followed by the current working directory (more
        about that in a little bit) and a dollar sign. If the last character of
        the prompt is a pound sign (“#”) rather than a dollar sign, the terminal
        session has superuser privileges. This means either we are logged in as
        the root user or we selected a terminal emulator that provides superuser
        (administrative) privi-leges.
      </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Try_Some_Simple_Commands">
      <header>Try Some Simple Commands</header>
      <p>
        Now that we have learned to type, let's try a few simple commands. The
        first one is date. This command displays the current time and date.
      </p>
      <code>[me@linuxbox ~]$ date Thu Oct 25 13:51:54 EDT 2007</code>
      <p>
        A related command is <ins>cal</ins> which, by default, displays a
        calendar of the current month.
      </p>
      <code
        >[me@linuxbox ~]$ cal October 2007 Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
        9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
        31</code
      >
      <h2>Ending A Terminal Session</h2>
      <p>
        We can end a terminal session by either closing the terminal emulator
        window, or by entering the <ins>exit</ins> command at the shell prompt:
      </p>
      <code>[me@linuxbox ~]$ exit</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Navigation">
      <header>Navigation</header>
      <p>
        The first thing we need to learn (besides just typing) is how to
        navigate the file system on our Linux system. In this chapter we will
        introduce the following commands:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>pwd - Print name of current working directory</li>
        <code>[me@linuxbox ~]$ pwd /home/me</code>
        <li>cd - Change directory</li>
        <code
          >[me@linuxbox ~]$ cd /usr/bin [me@linuxbox bin]$ pwd /usr/bin
          [me@linuxbox bin]$ ls ...Listing of many, many files ...</code
        >
        <li>ls - List directory contents</li>
        <code
          >[me@linuxbox ~]$ ls Desktop Documents Music Pictures Public Templates
          Videos</code
        >
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Determining_A_File's_Type_With_file">
      <header>Determining A File's Type With file</header>
      <p>
        As we explore the system it will be useful to know what files contain.
        To do this we will use the file command to determine a file's type. As
        we discussed earlier, filenames in Linux are not required to reflect a
        file's contents. While a filename like “picture.jpg” would normally be
        expected to contain a JPEG compressed image, it is not required to in
        Linux. We can invoke the <ins>file</ins> command this way:
      </p>
      <code>file filename</code>
      <p>
        When invoked, the <ins>file</ins> command will print a brief
        description of the file's contents. For example:
      </p>
      <code
        >[me@linuxbox ~]$ file picture.jpg picture.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF
        standard 1.01</code
      >
